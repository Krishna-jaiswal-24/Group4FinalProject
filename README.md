# Project Workflow Documentation(Aditya- Branch)

## Overview

This branch of the project focuses on integrating a **React-based frontend** with a **Node.js/Express backend**, employing **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for secure user authentication and **Axios** for efficient API communication. This document summarizes the workflow and structure of the project.

## Workflow Summary

### **Authentication Workflow with JWT**

1. **Login and Token Generation:**
   - When a user logs in, their credentials are sent to the backend for validation.
   - On successful authentication, the backend generates a **JWT** and sends it to the frontend.

2. **Token Storage:**
   - The frontend securely stores the **JWT** in **localStorage** or **sessionStorage**, ensuring it persists for future authenticated requests.

3. **Token Utilization:**
   - For all subsequent API requests, the frontend includes the **JWT** in the `Authorization` header, following the `Bearer` token scheme.

4. **Token Verification in Backend:**
   - The backend verifies the **JWT** for each incoming request using middleware. If valid, the request is processed; otherwise, the backend returns an **Unauthorized (401)** response.

5. **Logout Mechanism:**
   - Logging out clears the **JWT** from the storage, effectively ending the session and requiring re-authentication for further access.

### **Frontend Integration Using Axios**

1. **Axios Configuration:**
   - A centralized Axios instance is configured in the frontend to streamline HTTP requests to the backend. It automatically includes the **JWT** token in the `Authorization` header for authentication.

2. **API Requests:**
   - The frontend uses **Axios** for all interactions with the backend, ensuring data is fetched or updated efficiently.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Axios interceptors are set up to handle global errors, such as expired tokens or network issues. In case of token expiration, the user can be redirected to the login page.

### **Backend Integration**

1. **RESTful API Structure:**
   - The backend follows a **RESTful architecture**, exposing endpoints for managing user data, fetching resources, and updating information.
   - Key endpoints include fetching all courses, enrolled courses, and enrolling in a course.

2. **Middleware for Authentication:**
   - Backend middleware validates incoming requests by checking the **JWT** token provided in the headers. This ensures that only authenticated users can access protected resources.

3. **Error Responses:**
   - The backend provides meaningful responses for errors, such as **404 Not Found** for missing resources or **500 Internal Server Error** for unexpected issues. These responses are relayed to the frontend for user-friendly error handling.

## Summary

- **Frontend**: Built with React and uses **Axios** for API communication.
- **Backend**: Developed with Node.js and Express, exposing RESTful endpoints.
- **Authentication**: Secured with **JWT** for token-based authentication.
- **Data Flow**: API requests are authenticated with the **JWT** token, ensuring secure communication between frontend and backend.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized mechanisms for managing token expiry and API errors.

This workflow ensures a secure, scalable, and efficient interaction between the client and server components of the application.
